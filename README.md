## Project : Design of Backend for mixed-signal IC


The chip consists of two amplifiers and an oscillator. The backend has to ensure that these analog modules are initialized correctly and the chip is ready for use. The designed backend executes a start-up sequence to ensure all are initialized correctly. 

The chip will be interfaced with an external controller (most likely an FPGA) to control the start-up sequence
